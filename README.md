Aznauri Font
============

Aznauri is a font consisting of only capital letters.
It is well suited for titles, buttons, action links and
everything else to which the case of a letter doesn't matter.
The font consist of three variants:

* `RoundRegular` - A thin font intended for
  medium to large sizes (e.g. titles, subtitles)
* `RoundBold` - A weighty variant of `RoundRegular`
  intended for medium to large sizes (e.g. titles, subtitles)
* `SquareBold` - Squared corners for sharper appearance
  intended for small to medium sizes (e.g. buttons, action links)

Features
--------

* Metrics - Characters haves the same width whether they are bold and
  regular. Changing the font weight from normal to bold and the reverse keeps
  the text correctly aligned. No more wrapping, no more text overflow.
* Alphabets - Latin, Cyrillic and Georgian.
* Openness - The repository includes all the sources.

Drawbacks
---------

* Diacritical marks - Some letters require an acute (Â´) or a grave (`)
  on top of them. Due to the nature of the font these diacritical marks
  are included in the fixed height of the glyphs. Thus making
  the letter smaller in height.
